## checksum-checker
A simple Python script to calculate a file's checksum.
It doesn't require any dependencies (besides Python3 
installed, obviously). Works fast even for very large
files. This is intended to be simple, fast, and 
straightforward, with no things like installing 
additional modules or stuff like that.

Supports:
* `SHA1`
* `SHA256`
* `SHA512`
* `MD5`
* `CRC32`
