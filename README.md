## checksum-checker
A simple Python file to calculate a file's checksum.
It doesn't require any dependencies (besides Python3 installed, obviously).
Works fast even for very large files. Supports SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, MD5 and CRC32 (WIP).

This is intended to be simple, fast, and straightforward, with no things like installing additional modules or stuff like that.
